ETag (Entity Tag) is a part of the HTTP protocol used for web caching and conditional requests. It is a unique identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource. When a resource, such as a webpage or an image, is requested, the server can send an ETag in the HTTP header. The client's browser stores this ETag and sends it back to the server on subsequent requests to check if the resource has changed. If the ETag matches the current version on the server, the server knows the resource hasn't changed and can respond with a 304 Not Modified status, allowing the client to use the cached version and saving bandwidth.
Usage of ETag for User Tracking

Although primarily designed for caching, ETags can be misused for tracking users. Here's how:

    Unique ETags: A server can assign unique ETags to each visitor. When a visitor returns, the server can identify them by the ETag stored in their browser, effectively creating a tracking mechanism similar to cookies.

    Persistent Tracking: ETags can be more persistent than cookies because they are not easily visible to users and are not cleared when cookies are deleted. They can survive private browsing modes and some browser cleanups.

    Cross-site Tracking: If multiple websites share ETag information (for instance, through third-party resources like ads or analytics), they can potentially track a user across different sites.

Defending Against ETag-based Tracking

Here are some methods to defend yourself from surveillance via ETags:

    Clear Browser Data: Regularly clear your browser's cache, including ETags. This can often be done via the settings menu in your browser.

    Private Browsing Mode: Use private or incognito browsing modes, which typically do not store persistent data like ETags between sessions.

    Browser Extensions: Use privacy-focused browser extensions that block or regularly clear tracking mechanisms. Examples include Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, and ClearURLs.

    Disable Caching: Configure your browser or use extensions to disable caching or limit it. This can impact performance but increases privacy.

    Network-Level Defenses: Use VPNs or privacy-focused DNS services that may offer additional protections against tracking.

    Custom Headers: Use browser extensions or settings to modify or block headers that include ETags. Some extensions allow you to manipulate HTTP headers to remove or randomize ETags.
