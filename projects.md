# some project ideas

talk to me about details.

## ip messenger

* keeps contact list (it's possible to add/remove/edit a contact)
* contact is a name and ip address.
* message is sent as
```
  XMPPMessage :=
      '<message to="' + ATo + '" from="' + AFrom + '" type="chat" xmlns="jabber:client">' +
      '<body>' + AMessage + '</body>' +
      '</message>';
```

receiving party should show the message.

## network game

can be anything, chess, "sea battle", whatever.

* huge advantage if you implement it in decentralized way, i. e: it would work over xmpp.

both users just need to login to any xmpp servers, then during the game clients send to the other party xml messages.

## location sharing

get data from the gps sensor, share to other party.

ideally over xmpp. there's a XEP for that.

## http server

can be forking or cloning (threaded).

* should support basicauth, chunked and non-chunked transfer.

## http client

* should support BasicAuth and download password protected files.
* should support chunked and non-chunked transfers, when content-length is known or not known.
* should understand a couple of return codes, 301 - redirect - necessary.

it would be very good if you extend/improve my http client: https://github.com/norayr/http

## chat bot.

IRC or XMPP bot which can
* join a room
* log whatever is going on
* respond to a private conversation with anyone
* understand the command 'last N' where N is the number of messages to print.

## misfin client or server

misfin is a very simple email protocol.

## spartan/gopher/gemini browser

ui or console program that can receive .gmi and other files, render the page, go by links.

## Improve my Linux Oberon networking interface.

I implemented procedures:
```
(* Networking Procedures *)

PROCEDURE -bind(addrlen, addr, sockfd: LONGINT): LONGINT;
CODE {SYSTEM.i386}
  MOV  EAX, SOCKETCALL
  MOV  EBX, SYSBIND
  MOV  ECX, ESP  (* Parameters directly from the stack *)
  INT  80H
END bind;

PROCEDURE Bind0*(sockfd, addrPtr, addrLen: LONGINT): LONGINT;
BEGIN
  RETURN bind(addrLen, addrPtr, sockfd);
END Bind0;

PROCEDURE -listen(backlog, sockfd: LONGINT): LONGINT;
CODE {SYSTEM.i386}
  MOV EAX, SOCKETCALL
  MOV EBX, SYSLISTEN
  MOV ECX, ESP          (* pointer to [sockfd, backlog] *)
  INT 80H
END listen;

PROCEDURE Listen0*(sockfd, backlog: LONGINT): LONGINT;
BEGIN
  RETURN listen(backlog, sockfd);
END Listen0;

PROCEDURE -accept(addrLenPtr, addrPtr, sockfd: LONGINT): LONGINT;
CODE {SYSTEM.i386}
  MOV EAX, SOCKETCALL
  MOV EBX, SYSACCEPT
  MOV ECX, ESP          (* pointer to [sockfd, addrPtr, addrLenPtr] *)
  INT 80H
END accept;

PROCEDURE Accept0*(sockfd, addrPtr, addrLenPtr: LONGINT): LONGINT;
BEGIN
  RETURN accept(addrLenPtr, addrPtr, sockfd);
END Accept0;

PROCEDURE -recv(flags, len, buf, sockfd: LONGINT): LONGINT;
CODE {SYSTEM.i386}
  MOV  EAX, SOCKETCALL
  MOV  EBX, SYSRECV
  MOV  ECX, ESP  (* Parameters directly from the stack *)
  INT  80H
END recv;

PROCEDURE Recv0*(sockfd, buf, len, flags: LONGINT): LONGINT;
BEGIN
  RETURN recv(flags, len, buf, sockfd);
END Recv0;

PROCEDURE -send(flags, len, buf, sockfd: LONGINT): LONGINT;
CODE {SYSTEM.i386}
  MOV  EAX, SOCKETCALL
  MOV  EBX, SYSSEND
  MOV  ECX, ESP  (* Parameters directly from the stack *)
  INT  80H
END send;

PROCEDURE Send0*(sockfd, buf, len, flags: LONGINT): LONGINT;
BEGIN
  RETURN send(flags, len, buf, sockfd);
END Send0;
(* end of network procedures *)

```

I have checked that sending works. Receiving not tested.
Make it possible to send/receive messages.
Ideally, implement select(), poll(), epoll() wrappers.

It is semi-done for X86 but ARMV7 and MIPS CPU support is needed too.

Proof of concept would be to compile my http module and download a file from http.
Or my IRC bot can be run from within oberon os.
